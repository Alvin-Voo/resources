6. Background for reference in Perl 5
Perl design for Hash: Hash Values must be scalars

But a single reference can refer to an
entire array, and references are scalars, so you can have a hash of
references to arrays

8. Reference declaration syntax
[] - array
{} - hash

Invoke function reference with ->()
